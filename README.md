# Lab 3 - Data Binding: Building a Notes App
## Introduction
For this lab, you will learn how to build a Notes App using .NET MAUI. By following the tutorial steps provided by Microsoft, you will create a cross-platform app that allows users to create and save notes.  

## Purpose + Objectives
The objective of this lab is for you to walk through each of the steps in the tutorial and observe the construction of code used to build an entire .NET MAUI mobile application.  Step 4 walks through data binding and how to display content within the XAML view.     

The lab will contribute to fulfilling the weekly objectives listed below.

  - Explain .NET MAUI properties such as ItemSource, BindingContext and Command() 

  - Construct code to declaratively bind data to controls.

  - Demonstrate how to use an ObservableCollectionÂ and display a list of data objects

## Steps
1.  Start by reviewing the tutorial on the Microsoft Learn website: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/tutorials/notes-app/?view=net-maui-7.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/tutorials/notes-app/?view=net-maui-7.0)

2. Follow the tutorial step-by-step to build the app. Make sure to read and understand each step before proceeding to the next one.  The goal behind this lab is that you would take the time and study each step and gain a thorough understanding of the coding convention used to accomplish each task.

3. Record a short video using [RecordScreen.io](RecordScreen.io).  In your recording, be sure to that displays the files you created and demo the running application using your available emulator/device. Upload the recording to your files section of your Office 365 account and make sure viewing privileges are made available.  Add the URL to your recording in the comment section of Sakai.

## Submission Guidelines
For our first lab, all of the code pertaining to your project including the solution (.sln) file should be included within the issued repository. At the conclusion of the lab, submit the link to your issued GitHub repository.

Within Sakai, you will also need to submit a link to the recorded video demonstrating the completion of your lab.
